  <p style="color: #fff">"The day that my mom brought you home was one of the best days of my life. 
                         You were the tiniest little dachshund - the runt of the litter, actually - 
                         and I fell in love with you instantly, before I even really knew what love was. 
                         I was just a kindergardner, and I named you Lady after my favorite Disney movie 
                         at that age: "Lady and the Tramp." You were my best friend from that day forward. 
                         Best four-legged friend, anyway." - Amanda Sells</p>
